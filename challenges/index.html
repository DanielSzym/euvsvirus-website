      <p>
        Many Europeans are confined to their homes and limited in the exercise of their personal freedoms. As time
        passes, many more will soon find themselves in the same situation. The way we all are affected by this
        unprecedented compression of personal freedom changes completely from a person to another: the size of the house
        where we live in, the infrastructure of our city, the quality of the health service, the sector of employment.
        How can we keep social bonds strong under this extraordinary pressure?
      </p>

        With these perspectives, the remote working needs to be addressed in a better, controllable and impactful way.
