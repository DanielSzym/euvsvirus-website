                5.) Social Media Plug-ins
            </h2>
            <p>
                a) Facebook
                <br>Our Website uses plug-ins of the social network Facebook, a service of Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
                California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. You recognize the Facebook plug-ins on our Website by their
                Facebook-Logo or the “like button”. An overview over all Facebook plug-ins can be found here: <a
                    href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you visit our Website, the plug-ins establish a connection between your browser and the Facebook
                server. Thereby, Facebook receives the information that you visited our Website with your IP address.
                This occurs regardless of whether you click on a plug-in or not. When you click on the Facebook “like
                button” while you are logged on to your Facebook account you may link the information on our Website to
                your Facebook account. Thereby, Facebook can associate your visit on our Website to your Facebook
                account. We as the operator of the Website do not gain any knowledge about the content of the data
                transferred or their usage by Facebook. The data protection policies of Facebook provide additional
                information, in particular about the collection and use of data by Facebook, your rights in this regard
                as well as the options available to you for protecting your privacy:
                <a href="https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to prevent the transfer to and storage of data by Facebook about you and your interaction
                with our Website, you must first log out of Facebook before visiting our Website. In addition, tools are
                freely available on the market that can be used to block Facebook social plug-ins with add-ons from
                being added to all commonly used browsers: <a
                    href="http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/">http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                b) Twitter
                <br>Our Website also uses social plug-ins provided by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San
                Francisco, CA 94103, USA. When accessing our Website, which contains this plug-in, a connection from
                your browser to Twitter’s servers will be established. At this point, data will already be transferred
                to Twitter. Through this process, Twitter is informed precisely which page of our Website is being
                visited. We have no control over the data that Twitter collects in the process, or over the extent of
                the data that Twitter collects. If you have a Twitter account, these data may be linked to your Twitter
                account. To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of each website accessed as well as the
                IP address of the user but does so solely for the purpose of displaying Twitter components. Additional
                information may be obtained from the Twitter data privacy policy, at: <a
                    href="http://twitter.com/privacy">http://twitter.com/privacy</a>.
                <br>If you wish to avoid data being linked to your Twitter account, please log out from Twitter before
                visiting our Website. Interactions, in particular such as clicking the “Re-Tweet”-button will equally be
                transferred to Twitter. You may change your data privacy settings in your account settings on <a
                    href="http://twitter.com/account/settings">http://twitter.com/account/settings</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                c) YouTube
                <br>This Website also uses a plug-in of YouTube which belongs to Google Inc., San Bruno/California, USA.
                When you visit one of our websites containing a YouTube plug-in, a connection to the YouTube servers is
                established. By this, YouTube is informed which website you visited. Furthermore, in case you are logged
                on to your YouTube account, YouTube may also associate your surfing behaviour to your personal account.
                If you wish to avoid data being linked to your YouTube account, please log out from YouTube before
                visiting our Website. Additional information may be obtained from the YouTube data privacy policy on <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/static?template=privacy_guidelines">https://www.youtube.com/static?template=privacy_guidelines</a>.

            <p>
                d) Slide Share
                <br>On our Website we also use the java script code SlideShare operated by LinkedIn Ireland, Wilton
                Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland (if you reside outside of the United States) or LinkedIn
                Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA (if you reside in the United
                States). If your browser has java script enabled and in case you have not installed a java script
                blocker, your browser may transfer Personal Data of you to SlideShare. We have no control over nor any
                knowledge about the data that SlideShare collects in the process, or over the extent and purpose of the
                data that SlideShare collects. Additional information may be obtained from the SlideShare data privacy
                policy at <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>.
                If you wish to avoid the SlideShare java script to be activated, you can install a java script blocker
                (e.g. www.noscript.net or www.ghostery.com).

                Any non-material changes will take effect immediately upon posting of an updated Privacy Policy.
