                potentially illegal activity or violations of our terms or policies. Such processing is based on our
                legitimate interest in helping ensure the safety of our products and services.

                companies in order to provide or improve our products, services, and advertising; it will not be shared

                email services, marketing, sponsoring of the event, auditing, fulfilling customer requests, data
                analytics, providing customer service, and conducting customer research and satisfaction surveys. These

            <p>
                <u>Legal Compliance and Security</u>
                It may be necessary – by law, legal process, litigation, and/or requests from public and governmental
                authorities within or outside your country of residence – for us to disclose personal data. We may also
                disclose Personal Data if we determine that for purposes of national security, law enforcement, or other
                issues of public importance, disclosure is necessary or appropriate.
                <br>We may also disclose Personal Data if we determine in good faith that disclosure is reasonably
                necessary to protect our rights and pursue available remedies, enforce our terms and conditions,
                investigate fraud, or protect our operations or Customers.
            </p>
            <p>

                purposes such as email newsletters to future events held by the European Commission and/or the service
                providers involved.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Legal Basis For The Processing of Personal Data</u>
                <br>If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), our processing of your Personal Data will
                be based on the following: To the extent that we obtain your consent for the processing of your Personal
                Data such processing will be justified pursuant to Article 6(1) lit. (a) of the General Data Protection
                Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”). If the processing of your Personal Data is necessary for the
                performance of a contract between you and us or for taking pre-contractual steps upon your request, such
                processing will be based on GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (b). Where the processing is necessary for us to
                comply with a legal obligation, we will process your Personal Data on basis of GDPR Article 6(1) lit.
                (c), and where the processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate interests, such processing
                will be made in accordance with GDPR Article 6(1) lit. (f).
                <br>Please note that where you have given your consent to the processing of your Personal Data you may
                withdraw your consent at any time which withdrawal will not affect the lawfulness of any processing
                previously made on basis of your consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Transfer of Personal Data</u>
                <br>When we share your Personal Data with our partners and service providers, your Personal Data may be
                transferred to and/or made accessible from countries out of the European Economic Area. In such
                circumstances, we will enter into model contractual clauses as adopted by the European Commission, or
                rely on alternative legal bases such as the Privacy Shield, where applicable, or binding corporate rules
                where our partners or service providers have adopted such internal policies approved by European data
                protection authorities.
            </p>
            <p>
                <u>Your Rights</u>
                <br>We take reasonable steps to ensure that your Personal Data is accurate, complete, and up to date.
                You have the right to access, correct, or delete the Personal Data that we collect. You are also
                entitled to restrict or object, at any time, to the further processing of your Personal Data. You have
                the right to receive your Personal Data in a structured and standard format. You may lodge a complaint
                with the competent data protection authority regarding the processing of your Personal Data.
                <br>To protect the privacy and the security of your Personal Data, we may request information from you
                to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access such information, as well as to search for and
                provide you with the Personal Data we maintain. There are instances where applicable laws or regulatory
                requirements allow us to refuse to provide or delete some or all of the Personal Data that we maintain.
                In this case, we reserve the right to refuse to act on a request that is manifestly unfounded or
                excessive (for example because it is repetitive) and/or to charge a fee that takes into account the
                administrative costs for providing the information or taking the action requested.
            </p>
            <p>
                In your request, please make clear what information you would like to have access to or have changed,
                whether you would like to have your Personal Data suppressed from our database, or other limitations you
                would like to put on our use of your Personal Data.

            <h2>
                5.) Social Media Plug-ins
            </h2>
            <p>
                a) Facebook
                <br>Our Website uses plug-ins of the social network Facebook, a service of Facebook Inc., 1601 S.
                California Ave, Palo Alto, CA 94304, USA. You recognize the Facebook plug-ins on our Website by their
                Facebook-Logo or the “like button”. An overview over all Facebook plug-ins can be found here: <a
                    href="http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/">http://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you visit our Website, the plug-ins establish a connection between your browser and the Facebook
                server. Thereby, Facebook receives the information that you visited our Website with your IP address.
                This occurs regardless of whether you click on a plug-in or not. When you click on the Facebook “like
                button” while you are logged on to your Facebook account you may link the information on our Website to
                your Facebook account. Thereby, Facebook can associate your visit on our Website to your Facebook
                account. We as the operator of the Website do not gain any knowledge about the content of the data
                transferred or their usage by Facebook. The data protection policies of Facebook provide additional
                information, in particular about the collection and use of data by Facebook, your rights in this regard
                as well as the options available to you for protecting your privacy:
                <a href="https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/">https://de-de.facebook.com/about/privacy/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to prevent the transfer to and storage of data by Facebook about you and your interaction
                with our Website, you must first log out of Facebook before visiting our Website. In addition, tools are
                freely available on the market that can be used to block Facebook social plug-ins with add-ons from
                being added to all commonly used browsers: <a
                    href="http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/">http://webgraph.com/resources/facebookblocker/</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                b) Twitter
                <br>Our Website also uses social plug-ins provided by Twitter, Inc., 1355 Market St, Suite 900, San
                Francisco, CA 94103, USA. When accessing our Website, which contains this plug-in, a connection from
                your browser to Twitter’s servers will be established. At this point, data will already be transferred
                to Twitter. Through this process, Twitter is informed precisely which page of our Website is being
                visited. We have no control over the data that Twitter collects in the process, or over the extent of
                the data that Twitter collects. If you have a Twitter account, these data may be linked to your Twitter
                account. To the best of our knowledge, Twitter collects the URL of each website accessed as well as the
                IP address of the user but does so solely for the purpose of displaying Twitter components. Additional
                information may be obtained from the Twitter data privacy policy, at: <a
                    href="http://twitter.com/privacy">http://twitter.com/privacy</a>.
                <br>If you wish to avoid data being linked to your Twitter account, please log out from Twitter before
                visiting our Website. Interactions, in particular such as clicking the “Re-Tweet”-button will equally be
                transferred to Twitter. You may change your data privacy settings in your account settings on <a
                    href="http://twitter.com/account/settings">http://twitter.com/account/settings</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                c) YouTube
                <br>This Website also uses a plug-in of YouTube which belongs to Google Inc., San Bruno/California, USA.
                When you visit one of our websites containing a YouTube plug-in, a connection to the YouTube servers is
                established. By this, YouTube is informed which website you visited. Furthermore, in case you are logged
                on to your YouTube account, YouTube may also associate your surfing behaviour to your personal account.
                If you wish to avoid data being linked to your YouTube account, please log out from YouTube before
                visiting our Website. Additional information may be obtained from the YouTube data privacy policy on <a
                    href="https://www.youtube.com/static?template=privacy_guidelines">https://www.youtube.com/static?template=privacy_guidelines</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
                d) Slide Share
                <br>On our Website we also use the java script code SlideShare operated by LinkedIn Ireland, Wilton
                Plaza, Wilton Place, Dublin 2, Ireland (if you reside outside of the United States) or LinkedIn
                Corporation, 2029 Stierlin Court, Mountain View, California 94043, USA (if you reside in the United
                States). If your browser has java script enabled and in case you have not installed a java script
                blocker, your browser may transfer Personal Data of you to SlideShare. We have no control over nor any
                knowledge about the data that SlideShare collects in the process, or over the extent and purpose of the
                data that SlideShare collects. Additional information may be obtained from the SlideShare data privacy
                policy at <a
                    href="https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy">https://www.linkedin.com/legal/privacy-policy</a>.
                If you wish to avoid the SlideShare java script to be activated, you can install a java script blocker
                (e.g. www.noscript.net or www.ghostery.com).

                practices, and regulatory requirements, among other reasons. We expect most such changes to be minor.
                Any non-material changes will take effect immediately upon posting of an updated Privacy Policy.
                However, there may be cases where changes to the Privacy Policy may be more significant. In such cases,
                we will first provide a more prominent notice.
            </p>
            <p>
                Your continued use of our products and services after the effective date of the Privacy Policy means
