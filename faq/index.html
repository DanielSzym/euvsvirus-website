      <h2>FAQs for Participants</h2>
      <h3>What is #EUvsVirus about?</h3>
      <p>
        The #EUvsVirus hackathon offers a common organizational and technical framework in which the participants can
        get involved online and develop prototypes and solutions for technically, politically and socially relevant
        issues in the context of the Coronavirus crisis. It aims at collectively developing innovative solutions, e.g.
        high tech, low tech, hardware and software, using biotech, digital tech, societal science and other innovation
        domains. There are five areas that have been identified as targets for these innovative solutions:
        <a href="./../challenges/#health">Health & Life</a>,
        <a href="./../challenges/#business">Business Continuity</a>,
        <a href="./../challenges/#social">Social & Political Cohesion</a>,
        <a href="./../challenges/#remote">Remote Working & Education</a>,
        <a href="./../challenges/#finance">Digital Finance</a>, and
        <a href="./../challenges/#other">Other</a>.
        Detailed information about the topics can be found under the tab "Challenges".
      </p>
      <h3>Who runs the #EUvsVirus hackathon?
      </h3>
      <p>
        The Pan-European hackathon #EUvsVirus is a joint event between the European Commission and the
        most plugged in and nationally connected digital ecosystem actors from all over Europe. It builds upon
        already conducted national hackathons and their solutions. The organisers of the national hackathons
        related to coronavirus are the partners of the EU Commission on the pan-European hackathon.
      </p>
      <h3>When will the hackathon take place?</h3>
      <p>
        The hackathon will take place online from 24 - 26 April 2020. Participants will have 48 hours to
        collaborate via different online platforms and build a solution within the challenge areas.
      </p>
      <h3>How is the online hackathon organised?</h3>
      <p>
        The hackathon will take place online. The appropriate tools needed to facilitate the work of
        everybody involved will be provided. Slack will be the main communication platform for the teams.
        There will be live-streamings, webinars, Q&A sessions, and daily check-ins. For more information check out the
        <a href="./../agenda/">Agenda</a>.

        Developers, designers, creative people, problem solvers, digital entrepreneurs, makers, experts, and innovative
        start-ups from Europe - and for anyone else who wants to contribute and make an impact. Use your teams’
        interdisciplinary skills and be creative together to develop solutions that help all EU citizens to overcome the
        crisis.
      </p>
      <h3>Are there any specific requirements for participation?</h3>
      <p>
        There is no limit to the number of participants. Anyone who is interested in digitization,
        building digital tech or design solutions can apply. Whether computer scientist, tech and

      </p>
      <h3>Should I register as a team or as an individual?</h3>
      <p>
        If you already have a team, you can apply together and work on the challenges.
        Individuals can also apply. On Slack there will be many opportunities to get in
        touch with the community and find a team, based on your interests and knowledge.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I participate in the hackathon with my existing project/idea?</h3>
      <p>
        During the past few weeks we’ve seen an impressive number of initiatives to develop digital solutions and
        infrastructure to face the Coronavirus crisis. We have immense respect for your work. Feel free to register with
        your existing projects or ideas. #EUvsVirus is building on those experiences. You can submit an existing project
        and idea on DevPost after the onboarding on Slack. The information needed will be provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EU welcomes proprietary solutions. Prototypes, products, services and code which will be developed in the
        course of the hackathon remains in the hands of the creators. Prototypes, products, service and code and
        solutions which have been developed prior to the hackathon as well.
      </p>
      <h3>Where and how can I submit my ready solution at the end of the hackathon?</h3>
      <p>
        The solutions have to be submitted in English by 27 April 2020, 09:00 AM CEST/ UTC +2 (end of the hackathon) as
        a
        presentation video, ppt, demo, prototype (depending on the solution). Further information of the topic will be
        provided in the beginning of the hackathon.
      </p>
      <h3>Do I have to speak English to participate?</h3>
      <p>
        The official language of the hackathon is English. To facilitate the processes you should understand and be able
        to communicate in English. The submissions of the solutions have to be in English too.
      </p>
      <h3>Do I need preinstalled software?</h3>
      <p>
        No, you don’t need software beforehand. The technical infrastructure and instructions
        will be provided prior to the hackathon. However, it would be useful if you install
        Slack after your registration, since this will be the main collaboration platform.
      </p>
      <h3>Will we get any support during the hackathon?</h3>
      <p>
        There will be experts, mentors and coordinators with different knowledge backgrounds who will support you

      </p>
      <h3>What are the evaluation criteria for the final solutions?</h3>
      <p>
        The main evaluation criteria are: impact potential, technical complexity, prototype completion, business case.
        Detailed information of the judging criteria will be provided in the beginning of the hackathon.
      </p>
      <h3> What will happen with the solutions after the hackathon?</h3>
      <p>
        The pan-European hackathon will provide avenues for uptake by end-users or follow
        up development of the solutions. The teams with the best solutions will be invited
        to join the European Innovation Council (EIC) Community Platform that will facilitate
        connections with end users (e.g. hospital) and will also provide access to investors,
        foundations and other funding opportunities from the EIC and other EU financial supporters.
        It will also be a starting point of a much longer collaboration between the European Commission
        and the ecosystems of innovators, makers and start-ups across Europe related to
        the Coronavirus crisis.
      </p>
      <h3>How can I find my assigned team mentors?</h3>
      <p>
        Mentor coordinators assign one team mentor for each team and introduce the team mentors to teams through private
        group messages in Slack. Afterwards, the teams will invite their team mentors to their team channels. The team
        mentors will do the checkpoints with the team leaders. First checkpoint is 25 April at 2PM (CEST). To find the
        schedule of the other checkpoints look at the Agenda.
      </p>
      <h3>
