                Right of information and revocation
                <br>You have the right to inquire at any time, free of charge and immediately about the data collected
                about you. You can also revoke your consent to the use of your personal data with effect for the future.
                For this purpose, please contact the service provider stated in the imprint.

                Data protection (general)
                <br>When you access our website, general information (so-called server log files) is automatically
                recorded. These include the web browser you are using as well as your operating system and Internet
                service provider. These data do not allow any conclusions about your person and are statistically
                evaluated by us in order to improve our website technically and in terms of content. The collection of
                this information is necessary to be able to deliver the content of the website correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use of the website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as personal data
                (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far
                as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a contractual relationship is to be established, structured or amended or if you send us an enquiry,
                we collect and use your personal data to the extent necessary for this purpose (inventory data). We
                collect, process and use personal data to the extent necessary to enable you to use the website (usage
                data). All personal data is only stored as long as it is necessary for the purpose stated (processing of
                your enquiry or execution of a contract). In doing so, we take into account tax and commercial law
                retention periods. By order of the competent authorities, we must provide information about this data
                (inventory data) in individual cases, insofar as this is necessary for the purposes of criminal
                prosecution, for averting danger, for fulfilling the legal tasks of the constitutional protection
                authorities or the Military Counter-Intelligence Service or for enforcing intellectual property rights.
            </p>
            <p>
                We expressly point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have
                security gaps. It is not possible to protect completely against access to data.
                <br>The use of contact data published in the context of the imprint obligation by third parties for
                sending advertising and information material not expressly requested is hereby expressly prohibited.
                Exceptions to this are existing business relationships or you have received our consent to do so.
                <br>The providers and all third parties named on this website expressly reserve the right to take legal
                action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information. The same applies to the
                commercial use and disclosure of data.

                2. Liability for links
                <br>This website contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents no influence
                can be taken. Therefore, no guarantee can be given for these external contents. The respective provider
                or operator of the sites is always responsible for the contents of the linked sites. The linked pages
                were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
                recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is
                not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If infringements become known, such
                links will be removed immediately from this website to the infringing site.
            </p>

                <br>The contents and works on these pages created by the service providers, their employees and
                commissioned third parties are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution
                and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright law require the prior written consent of the
                respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private,
                non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights
                of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you
                nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware
