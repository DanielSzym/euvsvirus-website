      <p>
        Right of information and revocation
        <br>You have the right to inquire at any time, free of charge and immediately about the data collected
        about you. You can also revoke your consent to the use of your personal data with effect for the future.
        For this purpose, please contact the service provider stated in the imprint.
      </p>
      <p>
        Data protection (general)
        <br>When you access our website, general information (so-called server log files) is automatically
        recorded. These include the web browser you are using as well as your operating system and Internet
        service provider. These data do not allow any conclusions about your person and are statistically
        evaluated by us in order to improve our website technically and in terms of content. The collection of
        this information is necessary to be able to deliver the content of the website correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of the website is generally possible without providing personal data. As far as personal data
        (e.g. name, address or e-mail addresses) is collected, this is always done on a voluntary basis as far
        as possible. This data will not be passed on to third parties without your express consent.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a contractual relationship is to be established, structured or amended or if you send us an enquiry,
        we collect and use your personal data to the extent necessary for this purpose (inventory data). We
        collect, process and use personal data to the extent necessary to enable you to use the website (usage
        data). All personal data is only stored as long as it is necessary for the purpose stated (processing of
        your enquiry or execution of a contract). In doing so, we take into account tax and commercial law
        retention periods. By order of the competent authorities, we must provide information about this data
        (inventory data) in individual cases, insofar as this is necessary for the purposes of criminal
        prosecution, for averting danger, for fulfilling the legal tasks of the constitutional protection
        authorities or the Military Counter-Intelligence Service or for enforcing intellectual property rights.
      </p>
      <p>
        We expressly point out that data transmission on the Internet (e.g. communication by e-mail) can have
        security gaps. It is not possible to protect completely against access to data.
        <br>The use of contact data published in the context of the imprint obligation by third parties for
        sending advertising and information material not expressly requested is hereby expressly prohibited.
        Exceptions to this are existing business relationships or you have received our consent to do so.
        <br>The providers and all third parties named on this website expressly reserve the right to take legal
        action in the event of the unsolicited sending of advertising information. The same applies to the
        commercial use and disclosure of data.

        https://developers.facebook.com/docs/plugins/.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you visit pages with Facebook plugins, the plugin establishes a connection between your browser and

        already logged in can immediately publish content from our website on their Facebook profiles. As a
        result of using these plugins, Facebook can assign the visit to our website to your personal user
        account. We expressly point out that we, as the provider of these Internet pages, have no knowledge of
        the content of the transmitted data or its use by Facebook. Further information on data protection by

        the complete IP address be transferred to a Google server in the USA and anonymised there. On behalf of
        the operator of this website, Google will use this information to evaluate your use of the website, to
        compile reports on the website activities and to provide further services to the website operator in
        connection with the use of the website and the Internet. The IP address transmitted by your browser
        within the scope of Google Analytics is not linked to other data from Google.

        You may refuse the use of cookies by selecting the appropriate settings on your browser, however please
        note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full functionality of this website. You can also

        the analysis Google Adsense also uses so-called "Web Beacons" (small invisible graphics), which generate
        information such as visitor traffic on the site. This collected information (including your IP address)
        is usually transferred to a Google server in the USA and stored there. Google uses the information to

        evaluations of the website activities and advertisements for the operators of the website as well as to
        be able to provide further services with regard to the website and Internet use. The information
        collected by Google may be passed on to third parties by Google, by contract or by legal regulations.

        <br>You may refuse the use of cookies and the display of web beacons by selecting the appropriate
        settings on your browser, however please note that if you do this you may not be able to use the full

        Disclaimer (Disclaimer of liability)
        <br>1. Liability for contents
        <br>As a service provider, we are responsible for our own content on these pages according to § 7 para.
        1 TMG (German Telemedia Act) and general laws. According to §§ 8 to 10 TMG, we are not obliged to
        monitor transmitted or stored external information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal
        activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information according to general laws remain
        unaffected. However, liability in this respect is only possible from the time of knowledge of a concrete
        infringement. If we become aware of any such infringements, we will remove such content immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        2. Liability for links
        <br>This website contains links to external websites of third parties, on whose contents no influence
        can be taken. Therefore, no guarantee can be given for these external contents. The respective provider
        or operator of the sites is always responsible for the contents of the linked sites. The linked pages
        were checked for possible legal violations at the time of linking. Illegal contents were not
        recognizable at the time of linking. However, a permanent control of the contents of the linked pages is
        not reasonable without concrete evidence of a violation of the law. If infringements become known, such
        links will be removed immediately from this website to the infringing site.
      </p>
      <p>
        3. Copyright law
        <br>The contents and works on these pages created by the service providers, their employees and
        commissioned third parties are subject to German copyright law. The reproduction, editing, distribution
        and any kind of use outside the limits of copyright law require the prior written consent of the
        respective author or creator. Downloads and copies of these pages are only permitted for private,
        non-commercial use. Insofar as the content on this site was not created by the operator, the copyrights
        of third parties are respected. In particular, third-party content is marked as such. Should you
        nevertheless become aware of a copyright infringement, please inform us accordingly. If we become aware
        of any infringements, such contents will be removed immediately.
